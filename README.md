# Data_Cleaning_and_Analysis
This project focuses on utilizing SQL (Structured Query Language) for data cleaning and analysis tasks. The project aims to clean and preprocess a given dataset, ensuring data quality and consistency, before performing various exploratory analyses to gain insights and extract valuable information from the data.

Data Source:
The project utilizes a dataset containing relevant information related to a specific domain or problem. The dataset may include attributes such as numerical values, categorical variables, dates, and textual data.

Objectives:

Data Cleaning: The initial step of the project involves assessing the quality of the dataset and performing necessary cleaning procedures. This includes handling missing values, dealing with outliers, correcting inconsistencies, and ensuring data integrity. SQL queries will be used to filter, modify, and transform the data to achieve a clean and standardized dataset.
Exploratory Data Analysis: Once the data is cleaned, SQL queries will be employed to conduct exploratory analyses. This involves summarizing the dataset, calculating basic statistics, aggregating data by different dimensions.  The objective is to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships within the data.

Feature Engineering: In some cases, additional features may need to be derived from the existing data to enhance the analysis. SQL queries can be utilized to create new variables based on mathematical calculations, date manipulations, or aggregations. These engineered features can provide more meaningful insights and improve the predictive power of the data.
